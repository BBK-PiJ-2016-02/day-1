1. Changing the visiblity of a class method to private means we cannot access it call it outside of the class itself. If we wish to use this method on the SmartPhone class (while only making changes in the SmartPhone class) we would need to reimplement the method from scratch as we cannot access the original playGame method on the extended MobilePhone class.
2. It is not possible to reduce the visibility of a class method, this is because new classes should remain compatible with any classes they extend. For example if we could reduce the visibility of a class method from public to private by extending it, previously working implementations that used this code could break.
